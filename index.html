            <h3> Projects </h3>
            <p>The ensemble has collaborated with some of the city's top musicians and composers to challenge themselves and create projects that both inspire them and push them. Their music aims to connect with audiences in a way that is authentic to them and understandable.</p>
            <p> The group's projects include:</p>
            <h4>The Infinite Detail of This Place and Time</h4>
                <p> This is an emerging series of collaborations with visual artist Bridget F. Quinn and the Area Wilds Exploration (AWE) Society. Photos and videos of the live installments are available on their website, linked in the footer.<p>
            <h4>Listening for the Bells</h4>
            <p>This 2019 release was a piece the ensemble commissioned local Detroit composer Harriet Steinke to write. The piece is structured in four parts that can be played in any order, repeated, stand alone, or even blended together. The piece is described as a musical playground for the artists where they can challenge themselves to explore and be inspired by. The piece is available for listening on Apply Music, Spotify and BandCamp.</p>
            <h4>From Darkness We Awaken</h4>
            <p>This is Virago's latest project in collaboration with Detroit composer Michael Malis. The piece was released on August 26, 2022.

            <h3> Education</h3>
            <h4> Brave Performance Workshops</h4>
            <p>The ensemble is committed to fostering music education within the community. Through their Brave Performance Workshop students work to access their creative voice more fluently and frequently and to think abstractly and critically. They are taught to make democratic group decisions based on mutual respect and listening. Students learn about risk-taking and personal creative expression. </p>
            <p>The first program began in 2019 at Daily Elementary School and took place over the course of four sessions. The group still takes bookings for sessions. They can be contacted through their website, found in the footer.</p>
